# protocol_impl
An implementation of the Minecraft protocol

Some of my code is inspired by [go-mc](https://github.com/Tnze/go-mc), but I did not just skid, I researched most
of the things online to understand them. I'm doing this because I am interested in the functionality of the Minecraft
protocol.
